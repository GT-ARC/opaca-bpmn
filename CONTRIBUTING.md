# Contributing Guidelines

Copyright 2024 GT-ARC & DAI-Labor, TU Berlin

Main Contributors:
- BPMN Editor and Interpreter: Cedric Braun, Tobias KÃ¼ster
- LLM-based Process Generation: Anastasiia Zubenko

The BPMN-Editor and Interpreter are based on [bpmn-js](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js) and the [bpmn-js Token Simulation](https://github.com/bpmn-io/bpmn-js-token-simulation). The LLM-based process generation is based on [ProMoAI](https://github.com/humam-kourani/ProMoAI/).

Note that this (https://github.com/gt-arc/opaca-bpmn/) is the public repository of the OPACA BPMN Editor and Interpreter project, but the main development work still happens in the internal/private repository at https://gitlab.dai-labor.de, including most (internal) tickets, development branches, merge requests, build pipelines, etc.

If you only have access to the Github repository, feel free to create issues if you have any suggestions, or improve things yourself with a fork and pull request. We will do our best to address or incorporate them in a timely manner.
